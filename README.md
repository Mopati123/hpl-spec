# hpl_spec ? HPL (Spec-Only Universe)

This repository is intentionally **spec-only**:
- The top-level `_H` folders are **sub-Hamiltonians** containing operator registries and canonical documentation.
- No executable code has been written yet.
- Implementation will be generated later once the spec is frozen.

## Why spec-only?
To prevent semantic drift: the law is authored and reviewed first.
After freeze, Codex (or your team) implements against these specs.

## Next step
Paste the full conversation into Codex and instruct it to:
- validate coherence across specs
- propose missing definitions
- avoid writing executable code
