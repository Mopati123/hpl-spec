# Coupling Topology Conformance Tests (v2.2)

Required conformance:
1. Undeclared coupling is rejected
2. Illegal cross-sector access is rejected
3. Declared coupling emits a valid CouplingEvent
4. Deterministic boot yields deterministic coupling availability
5. If Commute is enabled, paired traces are deterministic and logged
